This is a project template for Svelte apps using netlify functions. The majority of this template comes from:  https://github.com/sveltejs/template. I have added some basic Netlify Functions setup to be able to quickly spin up apps that I plan on using with Netlify. For more information about the base template see https://github.com/sveltejs/template


## Prerequisite:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

## To base projects off of this template use: 

```bash
npx degit jlmelis/svelte-starter my-app
```

## To install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
```

To run use:

```bash
netlify dev
```
